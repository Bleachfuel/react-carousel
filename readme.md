## ‚ú® React Responsive Framer Motion Carousel ‚ú®

This carousel component provides a versatile and performant solution for displaying content or images within your React applications. It offers intuitive features that enhance user experience and empower developers like you with granular control over customization.

**Key Features:**

- **Seamless Swiping ( Touch-friendly ‚úã):** Enables users to navigate the carousel intuitively using touch gestures on mobile devices or dragging on desktop devices.

- **Navigation Buttons (Optional) (Ô∏è Control at your Fingertips üß≠):** Provide optional navigation buttons for users who prefer a more traditional control scheme, allowing them to easily switch between carousel items.
- **Customizable Transitions ( Smooth & Beautiful üå∏):** Leverage the power of Framer Motion to create stunning transitions between carousel items. Choose from smooth horizontal scrolling () or dynamic vertical scrolling () options to customize the user experience.
- **Automatic Pagination (Optional) (‚è±Ô∏è Set it and Forget it):** Allows automatic page transitions after a defined interval, providing a hands-free browsing experience.
- **Counter Display (Optional) ( Keep Track üö®):** Displays a counter indicating the current page and total number of items, giving users a clear understanding of their position within the carousel.

**Version 1.5.0**
## **‚ú® NEW FEATURE (external pagination ü™ê) ‚ú®**
> U can now reference the paginate function outside of the `carousel`. Useful when your `<button>` should be in a different place as the `carousel`, more information down below.
## **‚ú® NEW FEATURE (GoToIndex üî¢) ‚ú®**
> Enter a number in the prop and the `carousel` will move to the according index.


**Version 1.4.0**
## **‚ú® NEW FEATURE (navigation üß≠)‚ú®**
> Optional navigation that is dynamically added based on the amount of children. 
> - `carousel-navigation:` Control the overall navigation container.

## **‚ú® NEW FEATURE (Flexible Scrolling ‚ÜïÔ∏è‚ÜîÔ∏è)‚ú®**
> Choose between fluid horizontal scrolling () or intuitive vertical scrolling () for maximum control.  This enhanced flexibility allows you to tailor the carousel's behavior to your specific content and  user needs üòÆ.
## **‚ú®NEW FEATURE (OnChange callback ü§©)‚ú®**
> Ability to get updates from the `carousel` everytime it's index changes üöÄüîÑ.

**Installation:**

   ```bash
   npm install react-responsive-framer-motion-carousel
   ```

   This single command installs the carousel component along with its necessary dependency `framer-motion` within your project. While you might not directly use `framer-motion` extensively in your code, it provides underlying animation capabilities that power the carousel's functionality. This library is optimized for small file sizes, so the overall impact on your project's final bundle should be minimal.

- **React as a Prerequisite:** Make sure you are using this component inside `react`
- **Alternative for Non-Animated Carousels:** If animations aren't a requirement in your carousel, you could explore lighter-weight carousel options that don't depend on `framer-motion` üïäÔ∏è.

I know that the name is long, but all others were already in use üò•üò•


**Usage:**

Import the `Carousel` component into your React project and use it as follows:

```javascript
import Carousel from 'react-responsive-framer-motion-carousel';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Carousel>
        {/* Replace with your carousel content */}
        <div id="1"></div>
        <div id="2"></div>
        <div id="3"></div>
    </Carousel>
  );
}
```
**‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è:** When creating content dynamically. I.E via mapping, don't forget to add keys for each component.

**‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è:** If not using fullscreen mode, ensure the outer `<div>` has a fixed width, `display: flex`, and centers the carousel component. Set `overflow` to `hidden` or adjust the `range` prop. This prevents the carousel from extending beyond its boundaries.

**Unleash Your Design Creativity: Styling Freedom**

While the `react-responsive-framer-motion-carousel` provides robust functionality for managing content transitions and user interaction, the real power lies in its **extensive customization options**. This means you have complete control over the carousel's appearance (Meaning figure it out üòÜ). 

- **No Imposed Styles:** The component doesn't enforce any default styles, allowing you to tailor the carousel's look and feel seamlessly to match your project's unique design language.
- **CSS Integration:** Leverage the full power of CSS to define styles for various carousel elements like navigation buttons, counters, and individual content items. 
- **Component Flexibility:**  You're not limited to pre-defined elements. Feel free to integrate your custom components within the carousel for even greater design possibilities. Imagine embedding custom image containers, progress bars, or even interactive elements within each carousel item!

<br>

**Customization Options:**
- **`className` (string):** Add an additional CSS class name for styling purposes.
- **`type` (string):** Change animation style of the Carousel. Currently it has `horizontal` (default) and `vertical` mode.
- **`drag` (boolean, default: `true`):** Enable or disable dragging/swiping functionality.
- **`range` (number, default: `1000`):** Optional control for the distance the children animate in from.
- **`navigation` (boolean, default: `true`):** Buttons that navigate to the corresponding child. Active `index` is highlighted.
- **`controls` (boolean, default: `true`):** 
    - Show (true, default) or hide (false) navigation buttons that users can click on to move between carousel items.
    - You can customize the appearance of these buttons using CSS.
    The component provides pre-defined class names `next` and `prev` for targeting the buttons specifically.
- **`counter` (array, default: `[false, ""]`):** Optional counter configuration (array with two elements).
    - Element 0 (boolean): Controls visibility of the counter. Defaults to `false`.
        - `true`: Displays the counter.
        - `false`: Hides the counter.
    - Element 1 (string, optional): Custom string to display before the counter (if `counter[0]` is `true`). If omitted, an empty string is displayed. 
- **`noExit` (boolean, default: `false`):** Useful for stopping rendering issues with large objects; disables exit animation.
- **`swipeConfindence` (number, default: `1000`):** Adjust the sensitivity of swipe detection. Lower values make swiping easier, higher values make it harder.
- **`interval` (array, default: `[false, 0]`):** Configure automatic pagination:
    - First element (boolean): Enables automatic pagination (defaults to `false`).
    - Second element (number): Interval duration in seconds (defaults to `0`).
- **`intervalActive` (boolean, default: `true`):** Useful for controlling the interval. I.E stop the interval when hovering over something. 
- **`goToIndex` (number):** - Number u can pass to the `carousel` that will set the index. Remember child 1 is index 0  (navigation does the same, but this is if you want to implement your custom logic).
- **`onChange` (function):** - Callback that returns the index when sliding. Useful for knowing when u should display a `loading` state. More information down below.
- **`ref` (React.ref):** - Use the paginate function from the `carousel` externally (paginate(1), paginate(-1))

**Example with Customization:**

```javascript
import Carousel from 'react-responsive-framer-motion-carousel';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Carousel
      className="my-custom-carousel"
      drag={false} // Disable dragging
      counter={[true]} // Enable counter without string
      interval={[true, 3]} // Enable automatic pagination every 3 seconds
      intervalActive={true} // Activate the configured interval
      swipeConfindence={500} // Increase swipe sensitivity
    ></Carousel>
  );
}
```

**Example with loading, useRef and goToIndex:**

Even tho, the paginate `function` can be accessed outside of the `carousel` component. It is better to use the buttons provided and style them based on your needs. 

```javascript
import Carousel from 'react-responsive-framer-motion-carousel';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  // get the carouselRef
  const carouselRef = useRef(null);
  // state for loading
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  // setting the index externally, again better to use the navigation provided by the carousel and style accordingly
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(null)

  // set loading to false when the image is loaded.
  const handleLoad = () => {
    setLoading(false)
  }
  // set loading to true each time the carousel slides
  const handleChange = () => {
    setLoading(true)
  }
  return (
    <>
      {/*conditionally render loading if the content is being loaded*/}
      {loading && "loading..."}
      <Carousel ref={carouselRef} onChange={handleChange} goToIndex={index}>
        <img onLoad={handleLoad} src="" alt="" />
        <img onLoad={handleLoad} src="" alt="" />
        <img onLoad={handleLoad} src="" alt="" />
      </Carousel>
      {/*external pagination*/}
      <button onClick={() => carouselRef.current?.paginate(-1)}>prev</button>
      <button onClick={() => carouselRef.current?.paginate(1)}>next</button>
      {/*change the index (This will give the previous animation)*/}
      <input type="number" onChange={(e) => setIndex(e.target.value)} />
    </>
)
}
```
